1.Installing Apache - sudo apt update

2. Adjusting the Firewall - sudo ufw app list

  Output
  Available applications:
  Apache
  Apache Full
  Apache Secure
  OpenSSH

3.It is recommended that you enable the most restrictive profile that will still allow the traffic you’ve configured. Since we haven’t configured SSL for our server yet 
in this guide, we will only need to allow traffic on port 80:- sudo ufw allow 'Apache'

4.Checking your Web Server - sudo systemctl status apache2

5.Managing the Apache Process :

   To stop your web server, type: - sudo systemctl stop apache2

   To start the web server when it is stopped, type: - sudo systemctl start apache2

   To stop and then start the service again, type: - sudo systemctl restart apache2

   If you are simply making configuration changes, Apache can often reload without dropping connections. To do this, use this command: - sudo systemctl reload apache2

   By default, Apache is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, disable this behavior by typing: 
- sudo systemctl disable apache2

   To re-enable the service to start up at boot, type: - sudo systemctl enable apache2

6.Setting Up Apache Location

 

  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html

  sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html

 Upload your content to WWWW Location - sudo nano /var/www/your_domain/index.html
